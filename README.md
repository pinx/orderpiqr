# Order PiQR

Order picking with QR codes

Open the project in Android Studio and run.

First step was to create a new simple project in Android Studio.

Then, code was taken from [Google's ML vision demo](https://github.com/googlesamples/mlkit/tree/master/android/vision-quickstart). Only QR/barcode related stuff was copied over.

Necessary dependencies were added to `build.gradle`.
